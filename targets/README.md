# Validation targets

These are source-repository manifests and workload descriptions, not vendored
repositories. They contain no branches, pull requests, or remote checkout
state. See [`docs/target-manifest.md`](../docs/target-manifest.md) for the
schema, and `gotorque manifest validate PATH` to check one.

Pointing at live upstreams:

- `gojq/` exercises CPU, parsing, interpretation, and allocation behavior in
  a deterministic JSON CLI.
- `scc/` exercises filesystem traversal, classification, allocations, and
  scaling across generated source trees. Its runtime is mostly its own
  startup (a vendored dependency's `init` alone is 1.9 ms), so no source patch
  can reach the minimum improvement, and campaigns end inconclusive.
- `gron/` exercises JSON flattening and output formatting. Its benchmarks live
  in the module's root package rather than under `./cmd`, which is why
  discovery profiling widens past the target package.
- `yq/` exercises YAML and JSON parsing, query evaluation, and printing, and
  about half its CPU time is in the upstream YAML parser, which patches cannot
  touch. A Jev campaign accepted a fix here: compiling a constant regexp once
  instead of once per printed document made `yaml-select-emails` 6.0% faster.
- `chroma/` exercises a lexer-driven syntax highlighter. Its CLI is a separate
  Go module (`cmd/chroma`, with a `replace` to the root library), so the
  manifest sets `build.directory` (ADR 0023). About 40% of its CPU time is in
  the `regexp2` dependency, which patches cannot touch; the first-party levers
  are its lexer iterators and token allocation. Its first Jev campaign measured
  three candidates, all inconclusive.
- `go-jsonnet/` exercises an interpreter: field lookup, thunks, and
  allocation. Its workloads read `.jsonnet` files, which discovery cannot
  amplify, and a 90 ms run is too short for the macOS sampler, so the
  stress seed `fleet-config-profile` runs the same program at 60x (about 5 s)
  for discovery to sample.

Pointing at `asaf-shitrit/gotorque-targets`, which is not published yet. Both
validate, but neither can run a campaign until that repository exists:

- `dedupe/` exercises line deduplication and map behavior.
- `numstats/` exercises numeric parsing and aggregation.

Every target uses hybrid seed-plus-discovery workloads, representative/
plausible/stress tiers, network-disabled temporary sandboxes, exact output
normalization, and the default idiomatic optimization policy.
